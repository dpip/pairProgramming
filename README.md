# pairProgramming

Two programmers work  together in one station writing code! One "drives", physically types the input, and the other observes the input as it is typed in. Programmers switch positions during the process. The observer notes possible changes for the code, picks out syntax errors and possible problems to assess after the code is written.Pairs spend more time writing the code initially, but write better code during the process and end up with significantly less defects / syntax errors. 

A variety of experience and perspective are two huge benefits to this technique. Many errors and hang-ups can be solved by a second pair of eyes on the code. pairing an expert or more prolific programmer with a novice offers a learning opportunity on both ends.

Pair programming strengthens communication and eliminates imposter-syndromes. Most prefer to code alone but the same programmers are significantly more confident in their programming after working alongside a peer. Some are apprehensive fearing that the observer will be a "back-seat driver" and criticize negatively. It's important to pair with someone who is encouraging and is interested in a solution, not their ego. 

Pair programming is a great practice. Even if the project isnt a collaboration it's very beneficial to gain at LEAST one other opinion on the project at hand.
